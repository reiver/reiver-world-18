§ Kaah Possession

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, **kaah-possession** is part of the [[world-18-metaphysics]].

There are 2 parts to a being's **soul**: the [[baah]] and the [[kaah]].

The [[baah]] is a being's conscious self.
The [[kaah]] is a being's emotions, instincts, and adaptations.

When a being is alive, they can be taken over by and controlled by an emoition, or an instinct — this is called **kaah-possession**.

With some individuals, when the emotion felt is very very extreme, the **kaah-possession** can sometimes result in physical manifestations.
For example, their body and appearance //could// change while they are experiencing **kaah-possession**.
