§ Efret

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

An **efret** is part of the [[world-18-metaphysics]].

There are 2 parts to a being's **soul**: the [[baah]] and the [[kaah]].

If a being is killed or witnesses great suffering, destruction, or distress (whether their own or someone else's they care about), especially at or near the time of their death, then their [[kaah]] //could// transform into an **Efret**.

An **Efret** seeks violent vengence for the great suffering, destruction, or distress it witnessed..
