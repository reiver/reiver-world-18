§ Efret

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

An **efret** is part of the [[world-18-metaphysics]].

§§ World 18

[[world-18]], usually just shorterned to **18**, is an animation influenced by //another animation// that was based on a hundreds-of-years-old story called [[journey-to-the-west]] (西遊記) that featured the character [[son-wu-kong]] (孫悟空), as well as influenced by ancient Egyptian mythology, and Persian mythology.

§§ About

There are 2 parts to a being's **soul**: the [[baah]] and the [[kaah]].

If a being is killed or witnesses great suffering, destruction, or distress (whether their own or someone else's they care about), especially at the time of their death, then their [[kaah]] might transform into an **Efret**.

An **Efret** seeks violent vengence.

**Efret** are said to look like shadowy voids that are shaped somewhat similar to a regular body.

§§ Inspiration

The inspiration for the **efret** from **18** is the **ancient Egytpian** concept of the: **ka**, and the **ifrit** from Arabic mythology.
As well the modern Egyptian folklore of the **afarit**.
