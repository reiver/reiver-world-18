§ Sabzii Reproduction

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, [[sabzii]] are one of the [[world-18-lineages]].

Virtually all [[sabzii]] are **cosexual**, and are capable of 2 forms of //sexual reprodution// —

• //allogamy//, and
• //autogamy//.

With //allogamy// being more common, under normal circumstances.

Their //allogamy// is facilitated through a special organ called the //receptaculum seminis//.

Also, //parthenogenesis// does sometimes occur, but it is very very very rare.

When reproducing, a [[sabzii]] will lay an egg out of their mouth in a process known as **yoshitanjo**
