§ Konshoo Inspirations

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

⚠️ **SPOILER ALERT**

The inspiration for the [[konshoo]] character from [[world-18]] is the **ancient Egytpian deity**: **Khonsu**.
Whose name is also sometimes spelled as: **Chonsu**, **Khensu**, **Khons**, **Chons**, **Khonshu**.

In //ancient Egytpian mythology// **Khonsu** is either depicted with green skin, or depicted with a falcon head.

**18** focuses on **Khonsu** as:

• a son of Osiris,
• a son of Aman,
• his green skin, and
• as a protector.
