§ Aahk

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, the **aahk** is part of the [[world-18-metaphysics]].

There are 2 parts to a being's **soul**: the **baah** and the [[kaah]].

The [[baah]] is a being's conscious self.
The [[kaah]] is a being's emotions, instincts, and adaptations.

If a [[baah]] can become aware of and in control of its [[kaah]], then it can become the **aahk**.

The [[baah]] can then use the powers of the [[kaah]] through conscious choice.
