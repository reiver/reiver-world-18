§ Zoon

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Zoon** is one of the [[world-18-characters]].

**Zoon** lives in the village of [[seyawt]] on planet [[kemeta]].

Like all of his kind, **Zoon** has green skin, 2 long pointy ears, 2 short antennae, and purple colored blood.

§§ Family

**Zoon** is the adopted son of [[gorg-varka]] — who raised him from birth, and treats him and loves him like his own son.

He is the adopted brother of [[lupa-varka]] (who is the daughter of [[gorg-varka]]).
Although [[lupa-varka]] is **Zoon**'s adopted sister, [[lupa-varka]] acts more like a mother-figure to **Zoon**.

And is the adopted //grandson// of grand master [[jangshah]] (who is the //father-in-law// of [[gorg-varka]]).
