§ Zoon

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**World 18**, usually just shorterned to **18**, is an animation influenced by //another animation// that was based on a hundreds-of-years-old story called [[journey-to-the-west]], as well as ancient Egyptian mythology, and Persian mythology.

**Zoon** is a character from **18**.

He is the adopted son of [[gorg-ons]] — who raised him from birth, and treats him like his own son.

He is the adopted sister of [[lupa-ons]] (who is the daughter of [[gorg-ons]]).
Although [[lupa-ons]] is **Zoon**'s adopted sister, [[lupa-ons]] acts more like a mother-figure to **Zoon**.
