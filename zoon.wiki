§ World 18

[[world-18]], usually just shorterned to **18**, is an animation influenced by //another animation// that was based on a hundreds-of-years-old story called [[journey-to-the-west]] (西遊記) that featured the character [[son-wu-kong]] (孫悟空), as well as influenced by ancient Egyptian mythology, and Persian mythology.

§ About

**Zoon** lives in the village of [[seyawt]].

He is the adopted son of [[gorg-varka]] — who raised him from birth, and treats him like his own son.

He is the adopted brother of [[lupa-varka]] (who is the daughter of [[gorg-varka]]).
Although [[lupa-varka]] is **Zoon**'s adopted sister, [[lupa-varka]] acts more like a mother-figure to **Zoon**.
