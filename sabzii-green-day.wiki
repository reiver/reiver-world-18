§ Sabzii Green Day

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, [[sabzii]] are one of the [[world-18-lineages]].

Most **sabzii** observe a yearly tradition — called **green dayU* — where they ritualistically eat a certain plant.

Many **sabzii** farm this plant.

Most of the ritualistic focus is placed on the //green parts// of the plant.
But eating the non-green parts is imporant, too.

This tradition happens once a year.
Although some populations of **sabzii** observe it at different times of the year.

If the //certain plant// isn't available, other green plants are broadly considered acceptable.
But, in this situation, it is also believed to be importnt to eat other things, too.

It is said that this tradition brings //good health// to the **sabzii** participants.

It is also believed that those who don't participate in //green day// can develop [[the-hunger]].
