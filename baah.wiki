§ Baah

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, the **baah** is part of the [[world-18-metaphysics]].

§§ World 18

[[world-18]], usually just shorterned to **18**, is an animation influenced by //another animation// that was based on a hundreds-of-years-old story called [[journey-to-the-west]] (西遊記) that featured the character [[son-wu-kong]] (孫悟空), as well as influenced by ancient Egyptian mythology, and Persian mythology.

§§ About

There are 2 parts to a being's **soul**: the **baah** and the [[kaah]].

The **baah** is a being's conscious self.

Normally, when a being dies, their **baah** travels to [[duata]] — the world of the dead and the many deities.

After the death of a being, their **baah** can have 3 different forms —

• one form resembles their original body,
• another form resembles a specific type of bird called a [[baah-bird]], and
• yet another form resembles one or more hybirds of their original body and [[baah-bird]].

After the death of a being, some **baah** can travel from [[duata]] back to the world of the living, for short periods of time.

§§ Inspiration

The inspiration for the **baah** from **18** is the **ancient Egytpian** concept of the: **ba** and the **ba-bird**.
