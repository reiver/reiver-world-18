§§ World 18

[[world-18]], usually just shorterned to **18**, is an animation influenced by //another animation// that was based on a hundreds-of-years-old story called [[journey-to-the-west]] (西遊記) that featured the character [[son-wu-kong]] (孫悟空), as well as influenced by ancient Egyptian mythology, and Persian mythology.

There are 2 parts to a being's **soul**: the **baah** and the [[kaah]].

Normally, when a being dies, their **baah** travels to [[seduat]].

A **baah** can have 3 different forms —

• one form resembles their original body,
• another form resembles a specific type of bird called a **baah-bird**, and
• yet another form resembles a hybird of their original body and **baah-bird**.

The inspiration for the **baah** from **18** is the **ancient Egytpian** concept of the: **ba**.
