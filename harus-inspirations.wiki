§ Harus Inspirations

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

⚠️ **SPOILER ALERT**

The inspiration for the [[harus]] character from [[world-18]] is the **ancient Egytpian deity**: **Horus**.
Whose name is also sometimes spelled as: **Heru**, **Har**, **Her**, or **Hor**.

In //ancient Egytpian mythology// **Horus** is usually depicted with a falcon head.

**18** focuses on **Harus**:

• as a son of Osiris,
• as **Khonshu**'s elder brother, and
• as the power behind the ruler.
