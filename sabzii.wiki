§ Sabzii

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, **sabzii** are one of the [[world-18-lineages]].

Most **sabzii** have green skin, 2 long pointy ears, 2 short antennae, and purple colored blood.

Most **sabzii** have enhanced hearing, as compared to many other lineages.

§§ Skin Tone

Most **sabzii** have mostly green skin — with either pink or yellow patches with red borders.

The exact shade of **green*, of their skin-tone, can vary from individual **sabzii** to individual **sabzii**.

The exact shade of **green** of a **sabzii**'s skin-tone can even //sometimes// vary as they age — especially when they reach old age.

§§ Green Day

Most **sabzii** observe a tradition where they ritualistically eat the green parts of a certain plant.

This happens once a year.

If the //certain plant// isn't available, other green plants are broadly considered acceptable.

§§ Reproduction

Virtually all **sabzii** are **cosexual**, and are capable of 2 forms of //sexual reprodution// —

• //allogamy//, and
• //autogamy//.

With //allogamy// being more common, under normal circumstances.

Their //allogamy// is facilitated through a special organ called the //receptaculum seminis//.

Also, //parthenogenesis// does sometimes occur, but it is very very very rare.
