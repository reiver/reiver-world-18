Adult **sabzii** must also eat and drink (things other than water) from time to time.
But they can go years without doing so.

**Sabzii** children who do //not// do this can still grow, but it can take much longer to reach their full adult size.

The exact shade of **green**, of their skin-tone, can vary from individual **sabzii** to individual **sabzii**.

**Sabzii** are able to grow and stretch their bodies.
