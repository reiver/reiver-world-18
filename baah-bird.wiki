§ Baah Birb

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, the **baah-bird** is part of the [[world-18-metaphysics]].

Most **baah-bird** look similar to a **lanner falcon** bird, but where some the dark colored feathers of the **lanner falcon** can be blue or green on the **baah-bird**.
Very rarely, some **baah-bird** can look similar to a **saddle-billed stork**.
And even more rare, some **baah-bird** can look similar to **peafowl** — either the male **peacock** or the female **peahen** depending on the sex of **baah**.

§§ Explanation

There are 2 parts to a being's **soul**: the [[baah]] and the [[kaah]].

The [[baah]] is a being's conscious self.

Normally, when a being dies, their [[baah]] travels to [[seduat]] — the world of the dead and the many deities.

After the death of a being, their [[baah]] can have 3 different forms —

• one form resembles their original body,
• another form resembles a specific type of bird called a **baah-bird**, and
• yet another form resembles one or more hybirds of their original body and **baah-bird**.

After the death of a being, some [[baah]] can travel from [[seduat]] back to the world of the living, for short periods of time.
