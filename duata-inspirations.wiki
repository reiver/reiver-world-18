§ Kaahmaah Inspirations

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

⚠️ **SPOILER ALERT**

The inspiration for the name of the [[duata]] realm from [[world-18]] is the **ancient Egyptian mythological** concept of the under-world and after-life called **duat**, and the **ancient Egyptian** "**ta**" roughtly meaing //land//.

So [[duata]] = **"duat"** + **"ta"**.
