§ The Hunger

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**The hunger** is a very rare condition among the [[sabzii]].

Of the [[sabzii]] who have it — some [[sabzii]] are born the condition, while other [[sabzii]] develop the condition after they are born.

**The hunger** causes the [[sabzii]] who has it hunger to eat and drink (things other than just water) on a daily basis.
(Most [[sabzii]] only consume //water// on a daily basis, and eat and drink (things other than just water) much much much less frequently.)

[[sabzii]] who have //the hunger// can express changes in both their behavior, and their appearance.

One of the changes to their appearance includes their //skin tone// first becoming tan-colored and brown-colored — and then (if the condition persists) eventually becoming a depigmented bone-color.
In fact, [[sabzii]] born with //the hunger// are born with depigmented bone-colored skin tone.

There are stories of [[sabzii]] families where all individuals are born with //the hunger//, for every generation.

§§ Treatment

Some [[sabzii]] who are born with **the hunger** cannot be treated.
While others can.

Most [[sabzii]] who develop **the hunger** later in life can be treated, and become //normal// again.

Treatment usually involves participating in the //green day// ritual.
