§ Upuat Inspirations

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

The inspiration for the [[upuat]] character from [[world-18]] is the **ancient Egytpian deity**: **Wepwawet**.
Whose name is also sometimes spelled as: **Upuaut**, **Wep-wawet**, **Wepawet**, **Apuat**, and **Ophois**.

In //ancient Egytpian mythology// **Wepwawet** is often depicted as person with the head of a grayish haired wolf — of the type, of wolf, that are more common around Egypt, that are leaner and somewhat resemble jackals.

**18** focuses on **Wepwawet**:

• as an opener of ways,
• with his assocation with the city of Zawty,
• with his association with war, and
• with his association with death.
