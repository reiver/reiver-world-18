§ Putah Inspirations

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

⚠️ **SPOILER ALERT**

The inspiration for the [[putah]] character from [[world-18]] is the **ancient Egytpian deity**: **Ptah**.

In //ancient Egytpian mythology// **Ptah** is often depicted as person with green skin.

In some traditions, **Ptah** is the //first being// and the //creator deity//.

//Ancient Egytpian mythology// isn't a single //mythology//, but //many mythologies//.
The collective //mythology// had multiple //creation stories//, with different //deities// as the //creator deity//.
