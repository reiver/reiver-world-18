§ Harus

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, **Harus** is one of the [[world-18-characters]].

**Harus** is a deity.

**Harus** is //biologically immortal// — meaning that unless sometimes or someone kills him, he will continue to live on.

Like all of his kind, **Harus** has green skin, 2 long pointy ears, 2 short antennae, and purple colored blood.

**Harus** is the 1st son of [[usirus]].

**Harus** is [[konshoo]]'s older brother.

§§ Inspiration

The inspiration for the **Harus** character from **18** is the **ancient Egytpian deity**: **Horus**.
Whose name is also sometimes spelled as: **Heru**, **Har**, **Her**, or **Hor**.

In //ancient Egytpian mythology// **Horus** is usually depicted with a falcon head.

**18** focuses on **Harus**:

• as a son of Osiris,
• as [[Khonshu]]'s elder brother, and
• as the power behind the ruler.
