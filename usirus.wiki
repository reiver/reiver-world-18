§§ History

Long long long ago, **Usirus** formed a coalition — a trinity — with [[putah]] and **Sokar**.
Together, they led a faction that fought [[angel-amen]]'s faction.

During the war with [[angel-amen]]'s faction, at one point, [[putah]] was fataly wounded.
But before dying, [[putah]] fused with **Usirus** — such that everything that [[putah]] was was absorbed into **Usirus**.
From that point on, [[putah]]'s [[baah]] and [[kaah]] existed within the living **Usirus**.

**Usirus** was killed long long ago — but his [[baah]] an [[kaah]] live on.

**Usirus**'s [[kaah]] — being the [[kaah]] of a deity — is named **banebdjedet**, and it is symbolized by a male ram with its big curled horns — especially the head of the ram.

**Usirus** was killed.
When **Usirus** was killed, his body was cut up into pieces.
The pieces of his body were separated, and became like stone.
With one exception — one of his eyes remained alive.
