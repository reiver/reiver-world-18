§ Sabzii Legends

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, [[sabzii]] are one of the [[world-18-lineages]].

Some [[sabzii]] have a legend that the [[sabzii]] are the children of [[putah]].

There is another [[sabzii]] legend that the [[sabzii]] are the source of **dragons**.

There is also stories of [[sabzii]] born with [[the-hunger]].

Another [[sabzii]] legend is that — if a normal [[sabzii]] and a [[sabzii]] born with [[the-hunger]] fuse then — the result of this [[sabzii-fusion]] is something else — an atavus known as **the inferno**.
