§ Sabzii Inspirations

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

⚠️ **SPOILER ALERT**

The inspiration for the name "[[sabzii]]" are 2 **Persian language** words:

• "**sabz**", and
• "**sabi**".

The **Persian language** word "**sabz**" means **green**.

The **Persian language** word "**sabzi**" is the name of a //food// — which continues the pun of naming things after food.

An inspiration for the [[sabzii]] lineage from [[world-18]] includes:

• the **green sea slug** (also known as **eastern emerald elysia**, and **elysia chlorotica**),
• the **leaf slug** (also known as **leaf sheep**, and **costasiella kuroshimae**), and
• the **solar-powered sea slug** (also known as **sacoglossan**, and **sacoglossa**).

All of these slugs use chloroplasts that they take from algae that they eat.
This enables all of these slugs perform photosynthesis.
The "food" for organisms that perform photosynthesis! is water.
