§ Sabzii Inspirations

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

⚠️ **SPOILER ALERT**

The inspiration for the [[sabzii]] lineage from [[world-18]] includes:

• the **green sea slug** (also known as **eastern emerald elysia**, and **elysia chlorotica**), the **leaf slug** (also known as **leaf sheep**, and **costasiella kuroshimae**), the **solar-powered sea slug** (also known as **sacoglossan**, and **sacoglossa**) — which are all slugs which use chloroplasts they take from algae that they eat to perform photosynthesis.
