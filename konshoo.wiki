§ Konshoo

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

[[world-18]], usually just shorterned to **18**, is an animation influenced by //another animation// that was based on a hundreds-of-years-old story called [[journey-to-the-west]] (西遊記) that featured the character [[son-wu-kong]] (孫悟空), as well as influenced by ancient Egyptian mythology, and Persian mythology.

**Konshoo** is a character from **18**.

**Konshoo** is an adopted son of the (husband and wife) [[angel-amen]] and [[angel-amenet]].

**Konshoo** is the natural son of [[usirus]] — the second of [[usirus]]'s son, after (**Konshoo**'s older brother) [[harus]].

§§ Inspiration

The inspiration for the **Konshoo** character from **18** is the **ancient Egytpian god**: **Khonsu**.
Whose name is also sometimes spelled as: **Chonsu**, **Khensu**, **Khons**, **Chons**, **Khonshu**.

In //ancient Egytpian mythology// **Khonsu** is either depicted with green skin, or depicted with a falcon head.

**18** focuses on **Khonsu** as:

• a son of Osiris,
• a son of Aman,
• his green skin, and
• as a protector.
