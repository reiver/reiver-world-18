§ Kaah

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, the **kaah** is part of the [[world-18-metaphysics]].

There are 2 parts to a being's **soul**: the [[baah]] and the **kaah**.

The [[baah]] is a being's conscious self.
The **kaah** is a being's emotions, instincts, and adaptations.

Normally, when a being dies, their **kaah** stays in the world of the living.

The **kaah** usually seeks out something that resembles its original body to occupy — a statue, a painting, etc.

When someone dies, it is common for loved ones of the being who died, to place statues and paintings of the person near their body, so that their **kaah** will have a home.

A **kaah** that cannot find something to occupy can get lost, or even cease to exist.
