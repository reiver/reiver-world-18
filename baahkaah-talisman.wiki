§ baahkaah talisman

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

The **baahkaah talisman** is one of the [[world-18-artifacts]].

The **baahkaah talisman** can be used on both the dead and the living — but has a different effect on each.

For the dead, the **baahkaah talisman** is said to be able to reunite the [[baah]] and the [[kaah]] in the land of the living.

For the living, the **baahkaah talisman** is said to be able to help one become the [[aahk]].
Although sometimes things can go wrong, and the living user of the **baahkaah talisman** can become possessed by and controlled by their [[kaah]] -- and thus experience [[kaah-possession]].
