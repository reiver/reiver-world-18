§ baahkaah talisman

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, the **baahkaah talisman** is one of the [[world-18-artifacts]].

It is no coincidence that the name of the **baahkaah talisman** is made up of the works — [[baah]] and [[kaah]].

The **baahkaah talisman** can be used on both the dead and the living — but has a different effect on each.

§§ Usage On The Dead

For the dead, the **baahkaah talisman** is said to be able to reunite the [[baah]] and the [[kaah]] in the land of the living.

The holder of the **baahkaah talisman** must first locate a dead person's [[kaah]] in the land of the living (if it still exists) before this can be done.

§§ Usage On The Living

For the living, the **baahkaah talisman** can have 2 different effects.

In one usage, the **baahkaah talisman** can be used, by the user, to (try to) turn themselves or someone else, into an [[aahk]].

In another usage, the **baahkaah talisman** can be used, by the user, to put themselves or someone else under [[kaah-possession].

Sometimes things can go wrong when one is trying to use the **baahkaah talisman** to turn themselves or someone else into an [[aahk]] — and instead of becoming an [[aahk]], they accidentally put themselves or someone else under [[kaah-possession].
