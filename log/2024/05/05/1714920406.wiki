This is from the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world// — an animation myself and others worked on.

**Hessam Javaheri** created a story-board animatic — an animated story-board.

This //story-board animatic// is based on the 3 story-boards that **Soroush Eliasi** created earlier.

(And really, this is 3 //story-board animatics// — concatenated together, so that they play in series.)
