Drawings by **Mahour Pourghadim**.

From the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//.

Different //hair variations// for one of the important characters.

The idea for this character came from a collaboration between (in alphabetical order): Charles Iliya Krempeaux (i.e., me), Mahour Pourghadim, and Soroush Eliasi.

The variant that I liked the best, and thus the one we went with (i.e., //the winner//), was:

I think that version of the hair makes the character look more intimidating (than the other versions).
Which is important for this character.

There were 3 other variants that I didn't like as much as this one, but still liked.

(Perhaps one or more of those runner-up hair styles can be used for other characters.)
