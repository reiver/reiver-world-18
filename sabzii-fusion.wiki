§ Sabzii Fusion

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, [[sabzii]] are one of the [[world-18-lineages]].

There is a technique, called **sabzii fusion**, where 2 [[sabzii]] can fused together.
The technique has to be learned — but most [[sabzii]] have the potential to engage in it.

It is //not// an equal fusion, but one [[sabzii]] is absorbed into the other.

When this happens, everything that was the absorbed [[sabzii]] resides within the absorber.
It is believed that this includes both the [[kaah]] and [[baah]] of the absorbed [[sabzii]] — as there are stories that the absorber can //hear// and //talk to// the absorbed [[sabzii]] in their mind.

Typically the fused [[sabzii]] is stronger, and more powerful.
