§ Sabzii Fission

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, [[sabzii]] are one of the [[world-18-lineages]].

There is also a technique, called **fission**, where a //fused// [[sabzii]] can split again.
The technique has to be learned — but most [[sabzii]] have the potential to engage in it.

This can be considered the inverse of [[sabzii-fusion]].

Although it is a more difficult technique to learn than the **fusion** technique.
Much less [[sabzii] can do a **sabzii fission** than can do a [[sabzii-fusion]].

Note that this is //not// considered a form of [[sabzii-reproduction]].
