⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux


**Upuat** is one of the [[world-18-characters]].

§§ World 18

[[world-18]], usually just shorterned to **18**, is an animation influenced by //another animation// that was based on a hundreds-of-years-old story called [[journey-to-the-west]] (西遊記) that featured the character [[son-wu-kong]] (孫悟空), as well as influenced by ancient Egyptian mythology, and Persian mythology.

§§ About

**Upuat** is a deity.

**Upuat** is //biologically immortal// — meaning that unless sometimes or someone kills him, he will continue to live on.

The village of [[seduat]] has a long history of revering, exalting, and even worshipping **Upuat**.

§§ Inspiration

The inspiration for the **Upuat** from **18** is the **ancient Egytpian deity**: **Wepwawet**.
Whose name is also sometimes spelled as: **Upuaut**, **Wep-wawet**, **Wepawet**, **Apuat**, and **Ophois**.

In //ancient Egytpian mythology// **Wepwawet** is often depicted as person with the head of a grayish haired wolf — of the type, of wolf, that are more common around Egypt, that are leaner and somewhat resemble jackals.

**18** focuses on **Wepwawet**:

• as an opener of ways,
• with his assocation with the city of Zawty,
• with his association with war, and
• with his association with death.
