§ Duata

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In the [[world-18]] //animation// and //fictional world//, the **duata** is both part of the [[world-18-metaphysics]], and one of the [[world-18-locations]].

When a being dies, typically they [[kaah]] travels to the **duata**.

The **duata** is also the home of some deities.
